1. ES1868F sounds too quiet
   - R10, R12 should be 0 Ohm
   - R14, R15 should not be installed
   - C20, C25 should be 1 uF
   - R11, R13 should be 10 KOhm
2. ES1868F footprint is a bit smaller than required, so soldering it may be tricky
3. ES1868F is sitting on incorrect IRQ line after PnP configuration due to missing EEPROM
